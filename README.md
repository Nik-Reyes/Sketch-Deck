## Inspiration

When I think of pixel art, I think back to the classic Windows 95/98 era. So, I knew from the get-go that this project would have to look retro—but I wasn't entirely satisfied with recreating one-for-one the old windows look. I went searching for some more inspiration and came across a vast array of CRT TV menu UIs. I instantly fell in love with this style and so I started collecting some images from the web and plopped them into a Google Doc to refer back to. Below are some of those images
